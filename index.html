              <p><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_format.htm" target="_blank">format</a> is a disgrace, a black mark on Common Lisp. Packing a complex control language into a string is deeply insane when we could and should just use s-expressions. <code>format</code> is the single worst-designed feature in Common Lisp, even worse than <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loop.htm" target="_blank">loop</a>. <code>format</code> is <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/490937766411509761" target="_blank" class="tweet">not extensible, despite the very constrained <code>~/~/</code> escape hatch</a>.</p>
              <p>It is simply mind-boggling that <code>format</code> is still used and largely embraced by the community in 2020.</p>

              <p>lispy-format 1.0 properly translates the essence of <code>format</code> into a proper s-expressions form. A guaranteed smash hit!</p>
              <p>I know exactly what the final product will look like. There are 2 levels: individual functions which can be used standalone or in concert, and a macro for concisely and efficiently combining multiple output operations in one go.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be far more readable than <code>format</code>, and it will be completely modular and extensible. And of course, it properly uses the package system, so you can easily write your own extended version of the standard built-in operators if you like, or design your own features which will seamlessly integrate with built-in features and third-party features.</p>
              <p>One of several advantages of lispy-format 1.0 is that a command's arguments are specified with the command instead of all commands being specified ahead of time and then all arguments, making it hard to correlate commands with their arguments.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be very easy to learn, regardless of the user's level of proficiency with <code>format</code>. That said, <code>format</code> experts will find many familiar similarities compared to <code>format</code>, making transition easy. Tools should eventually be provided to help migration.</p>

              <p>This library will implement a revolutionary new paradigm for iteration and mapping. It is extremely simple, intuitive, modular, flexible, powerful and optimizable, and easily scales from trivial use-cases to very complex, so you can just use it always. It will basically obsolete every iteration and mapping construct you know of, and then some.</p>

              <p>This is a spiritual successor to my various Loopless projects that I worked on for years and <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" class="tweet"> deleted relatively recently</a>, and other related work such as <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/multiple-value-variants/#mapcar" target="_blank">multiple-value mapping</a>. I completely stopped using <code>loop</code> eons ago and now make heavy use of <code>mapcar</code> and friends, but this is not enough and after several iterations of failed attempts at LOOP replacement, I finally came up with a truly revolutionary paradigm shift in computer science (or at least, a very big evolutionary leap). This is actually just a different arrangement of already existing concepts such as iterators, but designed and integrated in a much more flexible and powerful way without sacrificing performance (and in fact, improving it).</p>
              <p>I already know what the project will be called, but I'm keeping it a secret until a first release.</p>
              <p>I already know exactly what the high-level syntax and semantics will be. I could trivially tell you what it is, but I want to keep all the glory for myself on this one. ;P (It took me quite a bit of really hard work to reach that point, and if I immediately revealed the fruits of my labor then someone could implement a crude version and reap all the glory before I have perfected the entirety of the design at all layers of abstraction.) The high-level syntax and semantics is actually just an embarrassingly simple variation on one of the standard Common Lisp constructs.</p>
              <p>As for the mid-level and low-level semantics, I have some good ideas about it, but much work yet remains to be done. I recently became an expert in an area of the <a href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">MOP</a> that I believe will be absolutely crucial to the mid-level and low-level semantics.</p>
              <p>I have already spent several months designing this on graph paper. I am now ready to try actually implementing this (once I'm done with the above work items).</p>
