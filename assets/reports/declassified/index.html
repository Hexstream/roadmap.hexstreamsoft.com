            <p>
              Mastodon will have to wait, as I simply don't have the time to set it up.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest" target="_blank">Wildebeest</a> is already an unmaintained project. :(

              <br class="if-wide"/>
              The engagement there for me is simply <em>batshit insane...</em>

          <section class="subsection" id="a-word-of-thanks_3_duolingo,almost-dying,spanish-friend">

            <p>
              I'm still going strong on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, although <strong>I cut down on the competitive aspects by setting my profile to private
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                so as to opt out of the leaderboards as that was just wasting my time and actually preventing me from
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                properly progressing through the course and achieving my language learning goals.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>I would normally have a 896 days streak on Duolingo,</em>
              <br class="unless-very-wide"/>
              but unfortunately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerhaave_syndrome" target="_blank">I almost died for no reason in May 2023</a> and the long hospital stay broke my streak, so I only have a 253 days streak. :(
            </p>

            <p>
              I again finished the Spanish course, as they had added <em>quite</em> a lot of material.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              My (written) Spanish is now <em>quite</em> good, and I am hoping to achieve native-like proficiency in reading and writing within a few years.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <em>I also made a Spanish friend!</em> :)
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, my Portuguese story is not quite so bright.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I finished Duolingo's Portuguese-from-Spanish course, but it's far too basic.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I want to complete the Portuguese-from-English course eventually, but for now I'm concentrating on improving my Spanish.

          <section class="subsection" id="a-word-of-thanks_3_telegram-retardation">

            <p>
              I had indeed joined <a href="https://t.me/commonlispbr" target="_blank">the (Portuguese) Common Lisp Brasil channel on Telegram</a>, it was great for a while
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              (despite my needing to use <a href="https://www.deepl.com/" target="_blank">automated translation</a> constantly for writing since my Portuguese skills were simply too low)
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              but then some stupid corruption shit happened and some stupid scammer who was somehow part of the admin team
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              banned me for no fucking reason and the channel's owner was too fucking spineless to do anything at all about it.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              If that sounds completely retarded, that's because <em>it is.</em> On top of that, I found out the hard way that <strong><a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/commit/0f4eebc0309cfe54a9c38a5dcb53699e0c889186" target="_blank">Telegram is broken by design</a>.</strong>

            <p>

          <section class="subsection" id="a-word-of-thanks_3_weight-lifting">

            <p>
              Admittedly I cut back on the weight lifting, as nearly dying has unfortunately left me at around 85% strength, perhaps permanently.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <em>Oh well, that's still a lot better than 0%!</em>

              <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/tools/tmux/" target="_blank">My advanced tmux config</a> has of course long been completed, and is very comfortable!
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I can easily make updates across dozens of projects at once!
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Unfortunately, I believe the tmux development process has mostly collapsed under the weight of excessive Greenspunning.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <em>I am dreaming of writing a tmux replacement in Common Lisp one day...</em>

            <p>
              I did implement vast CSS loading and HTTP caching optimizations globally across all my websites,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and this has resulted in a glorious increase in performance, especially on first load.

              <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/#offline-support" target="_blank">Offline support will come much later.</a>

              (<em>I note in passing that <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-wrapped-2023" target="_blank">2023 has been a truly BATSHIT INSANE year for CSS!</a></em>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Some personal favorites are <strong><em>nesting, :has() and container queries.</em></strong>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              These have been a long time coming and will be truly revolutionary for me once they reach Baseline Widely Available status!

            <p>
              So, how was my 2023? Well, it's kind of a blur, really. My memory is kinda shit these days.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I do know I was very productive overall, but the almost-dying-for-no-reason thing monopolized a lot of my time and energy.

          <section class="subsection" id="a-word-of-thanks_3_fonts">

            <p>
              I learned a LOT about font technology, notably reading almost the entire <a href="https://fontforge.org/en-US/" target="_blank">FontForge</a> manual!
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Unfortunately, I don't have much to show for it concretely,

              but it's always nice to invest in learning fundamental and foundational technologies.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              We couldn't even do anything non-trivial with computers without fonts!

            <p>
              I made some good progress towards releasing <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/definitions-systems/" target="_blank">definitions-systems</a> 4.0, another major update to my most important library.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              This has been uncharacteristically hard, resulting in multiple dead-end private development branches,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              but now I think the hard part is done and I know how to consolidate everything into a nice simple solution.

                <br class="if-wide"/>
                This is one of my most personally-important projects ever!</em>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              This completely supersedes and obsoletes my good English/French keyboard configuration for desktop
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and my shitty English/French/Spanish/Portuguese keyboard configuration for mobile.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also completely refactored the keyboard presentation, and added fallback layers to allow me to type Dvorak even in a QWERTY environment,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              in case I'm ever temporarily stuck in a QWERTY-only environment such as BIOS setup.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              (I also finally changed my mobile tap layout to Dvorak, so now I can safely completely forget QWERTY!)
            </p>

            <p>
              I have not yet widely announced my new awesome keyboard layout, as I want to improve my advanced keyboard presentation even more, first.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Notably, I want to add options to select individual keys and to show the correspondance to a conventional keyboard,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              as my new keyboard configuration is designed to logically map almost 1:1 to a conventional keyboard.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I also want an option to show scancodes. And I want to improve the feature descriptions...

              I am very confident I will complete at least the first two items in 2024, and hopefully I can at least put a dent in the third one...
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond that, I want to start my professional blog in 2024.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              And I'm sure I'll do a lot of other interesting stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
              Anyway, that's about it! <em>I hope this has been informative and exciting!

            <p>

          <p>First, obviously, a little retrospective on my first word of thanks would be in order! <em>Let's see...</em></p>

            <p>
              Ok, so first of all, indeed my main twitter account is still locked forever for no reason whatsoever.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I had thought that Elon Musk's "Amnesty" thing would solve that problem, but it seems not after all. <em>Disappointing!</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I have not yet started my inevitable migration to Mastodon,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              as <strong>I have been experiencing MASSIVE UNEXPECTED SUCCESS <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hexstream" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a> since late March 2022.</strong>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <strong>Now with <em>7000+ connections/followers,</em> most of them programmers and related,</strong> Mastodon can wait! :)
            </p>

            <p>(<em>INSANE timing:</em> Cloudflare actually announced "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-wildebeest-the-fediverse-on-cloudflare/" target="_blank">Wildebeest</a>" just 2 hours ago! <em>Interesting...</em>)</p>

            <p><strong>The Common Lisp Open Source group on LinkedIn has also reached <em>1000+ members</em> on 30 january 2023, up from 100-something in late March 2022.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                This is the kind of growth I would like to see <em>(and enact)</em> in the Common Lisp community!

              <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am still going strong on Duolingo, now with a streak of 531 days!</a> I was again in the top 0.1% of users in 2022, of course.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <strong>I completed the Spanish course</strong> on 31 december 2022, and then immediately started tearing through
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              the <strong>Portuguese</strong> (from Spanish) course and had already completed 1/3 of the course a month later.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              This is a bit time-intensive (like a part-time job), thus slowing down my operations, but <em>the payoffs later will be HUGE!!!</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I am indeed self-evaluating my current level of Spanish as "Limited Professional Proficiency",
              <br class="unless-very-wide"/>
              or rather "<a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#languages_spanish" target="_blank">Professional working proficiency</a>" as it is now called these days it seems.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I had initially planned to learn Spanish to a more advanced level before starting to learn Portuguese,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              but I figure knowing both languages at a good level would be much more useful than being extremely good at Spanish and not knowing Portuguese at all.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I also see that there is some sort of Portuguese Common Lisp community, which I am eager to join.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>I will learn a FUCKTON of languages and spread the joy of Common Lisp to the entire world!</em></strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong>I actually just got <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/log/#donations_matt-doughty" target="_blank">a new big sponsor</a>!!</strong> 🎉
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I frankly hadn't expected that to happen right now, given the state of my online presence.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>This is inspiring me to release MAJOR upgrades to <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft Sponsors</a>, earlier than originally planned!
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                For instance, individuals will have the option of adding their name at the bottom of <em>all pages on <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">the site</a>,</em> starting at 10$/month.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                Meanwhile, companies and individuals will have the option of adding their name at the <em>top</em> of all pages, starting at 100$/month.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                Needless to say, <em>this completely BLOWS AWAY most offerings on the market!</em></strong>
            </p>

            <p>This will of course use the existing "<a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#monthly-perks" target="_blank">Monthly Perks Credits</a>" system, so you will be able to leverage your existing investments any time you like.</p>

            <p>

                Please <a href="mailto:sponsors@hexstreamsoft.com" target="_blank">let me know</a> if you would like to activate this, as it is opt-in.</strong>

            <p><em>Hello my longuest active sponsors ever!!</em></p>

            <p>
              Since you recently completed a few notable milestones, I thought I would take the opportunity to
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <strong><em>thank you from the bottom of my heart</em></strong> for heroically supporting me through a pretty tough time!
            </p>

            <p>
              I <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/log/" target="_blank">note</a> in particular that you have already been supporting me for <em>more than a year,</em>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and have now between you two contributed <em>almost exactly 200$ CAD</em> to my finances,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and are now <em>my #3 and #4 biggest sponsors ever</em> as of yesterday!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>This is quite unexpected and very much appreciated!</strong>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Given the current state of my finances (I had around 10$ in my bank accounts a few weeks ago!),
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              even seemingly modest contributions have a surprisingly big impact!

          <section class="subsection" id="a-word-of-thanks_1_twitter,mastodon">

            <p>
              Now, you might have noticed that <a href="https://blog.hexstream.xyz/about-phoe/#27_january_2021" target="_blank">the Common Lisp mafia scammed twitter into locking my account forever for no reason whatsoever</a>.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <em>They certainly have a knack for sabotaging important Common Lisp infrastructure for their sole benefit at the expense of everyone else!</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, that has been quite a devastating blow to my life and operations, and I cannot meaningfully resume my Common Lisp activities at this time.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              This indeed spells the end of "Hexstream 1.0", but fear not, as <strong>I have already begun planning and implementing "Hexstream 2.0"!!</strong>

            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>This year I will be moving on to <em>self-hosted <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>,</em></strong> which will <strong><em>PROFOUNDLY AND PERMANENTLY</em></strong> revolutionize ALL my operations,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              in fact <em>it will be much better than when I could use my twitter account</em> (although I would very much like to regain access to it one day).
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              <strong>This will unlock a panoply of great benefits:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul class="list">

              <li><p>I can create as many accounts as I wish for <a href="https://abc.hexstream.xyz/websites/" target="_blank">my various activities</a>, which will give me and my followers unprecedented flexibility;</p></li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  I will completely own my own data and <strong>it will be virtually impossible to censor me <em>at the source,</em></strong>
                  <br class="unless-very-wide"/>
                  or otherwise completely fuck up my operations for no reason whatsoever.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><p>The 500 characters max post length (compared to twitter's 280) will be one of many welcome improvements in usability.</p></li>

              <li><p>I will have full control to curate replies <em>on my own server</em> as needed to delete stupid scams and other undesirable content.</p></li>

              <li><p><em>My content</em> will drive tons of traffic to <em>MY website</em> rather than twitter's. ;P</p></li>

            <p>
              <strong>I am also looking to <em>INTERNATIONALIZE</em> most of my operations.</strong>
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              One of the best things I ever did was mobile-optimizing all my websites, and this is the next logical step.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              I have always had strong innate abilities for learning languages,
              <br class="unless-very-wide"/>
              as evidenced by achieving a pretty high level of French and English with relatively little effort,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and the time has come to lean into that ability much more.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> on 27 august 2021, initially with the goal of learning <strong>Japanese</strong>.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              After a few months of very intensive study, I realized that learning that language to a professional level would definitely take me years even in the best of cases,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              so I instead switched to the easiest (and thus fastest) language I could possibly learn as a third language: <strong>Spanish</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I already completed more than half of the course in less than 3 months!

              In fact, I was in the Top 0.1% of users on Duolingo in 2021, despite joining fairly late in the year.

              As of today, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Hexstream" target="_blank">I have a 166 days streak</a>. Feel free to <a href="https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKSMEA2Q4WE7F4BU?v=la" target="_blank">join me</a> on this awesome language-learning platform!

              Once I'm done with the Spanish course, I think I will already be at a "Limited Professional Proficiency" level,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and I expect I will be able to achieve a native-like level (at least in reading and writing) within a few years of using it as part of my operations.

              Going from 2 mastered languages to 3 is actually a HUGE step strategically,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              as for instance I could create a website for helping to learn between SIX (instead of two) pairs of languages:
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              French to English, English to French, French to Spanish, English to Spanish, Spanish to French, Spanish to English.
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              Of course, I still have an intense desire to learn Japanese eventually, and why not, even Chinese and others!
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              In fact, <strong><em>I want to become a hyperpolyglot!</em></strong> (6+ languages)

              I will also consolidate the rest of <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my infrastructure</a> on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a>, once they finally release their awesome <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/" target="_blank">R2, a S3-like storage platform</a> soon.

              I will finally have everything I need to finally get rid of my 5$/month DigitalOcean VPS and its various limitations and management burdens,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              and I can finally re-introduce a <em>build step</em> to my web infrastructure to help me cope better until I can finally use <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/far/#second-web-framework" target="_blank">my second web framework</a>.

              Last but not least, I am planning my big "return" (although I never left) to Common Lisp for <strong>2023</strong> with

              I did not want to do this without my second web framework,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              but now I deem us to have <em>ran out of time</em> on this <strong>PATENTLY OBVIOUS <em>BATSHIT INSANE EMERGENCY</em></strong>,
              <br class="if-wide"/>
              so I just have to do it, and the aforementioned <em>build step</em> should make things bearable, hopefully.
