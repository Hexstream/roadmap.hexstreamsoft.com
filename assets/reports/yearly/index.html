        <p><strong><em>Happy New Year!!</em></strong></p>

        <section class="subsection" id="2026_hexstream.link,pitch-thing,log-upgrade">

          <p>
            So, 2025 has been a very productive year, I mostly don't remember the details (many of which involved important upgrades to the HTML across all my websites)
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            but the two most important user-visible releases have been <a href="https://hexstream.link/" target="_blank">hexstream.link</a> (a partial list of such links is <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/hexstream.link/tree/master/redirects" target="_blank">here</a>) and <a href="https://hexstream.link/cl" target="_blank">my Common Lisp Pitch Thing</a>. (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404244707800743938" target="_blank">See more context on LinkedIn.</a>)
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            I also <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/#24_november_2025" target="_blank">announced</a> a truly epic upgrade to the HexstreamSoft Sponsors log, which will of course be my first big databasification.
          </p>

        </section>

        <section class="subsection" id="2026_linkedin">

          <p>
            I am continuing to experience some pretty good success on LinkedIn, now with 14000+ connections/followers and several dozens of very successful comments this year alone,
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            and I also started posting more main posts and getting some success there as well. My launch of The Great Common Lisp Revival before 2030 will be <em>truly epic!!</em>
          </p>

        </section>

        <p>Major changes to my life starting towards the end of 2025:</p>

        <ul class="list">

          <li>
            <section class="subsection" id="2026_dropped-duolingo">
              <p>
                <strong>I dropped Duolingo</strong> and uninstalled the app after a little over 4 years, finishing with a 1500 days streak.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                I have no plans to use Duolingo again until I am ready to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/#internationalization" target="_blank">internationalize my websites</a>.
              </p>
            </section>
          </li>

          <li>
            <section class="subsection" id="2026_piano">
              <p>
                <strong>I started playing the piano,</strong> one of my biggest childhood dreams that just can't wait anymore, especially since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerhaave_syndrome" target="_blank">I almost died for no fucking reason</a> in May 2023.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                I started with Duolingo Music, which was nice to learn the individual notes, but I quickly upgraded to Simply Piano which is really great but normally pretty expensive,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                but fortunately I got a nice 50% rebate for a year and I think I should be able to finish pretty much all the content in a year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stupidly falling for the hype, I bought the <a href="https://store.duolingo.com/products/loog-x-duolingo-piano" target="_blank">Duolingo Piano</a> which I thought would be great to start,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                but it turned out to be overpriced flimsy crap that breaks down like every 2 months so I'll have to return that shit for a refund,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                and I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00UJ9LNDK" target="_blank">a fairly high-end and full-featured but affordable beginner model</a> instead (and I got a nice 100$ rebate thanks to Black Friday).
              </p>
            </section>
          </li>

          <li>
            <section class="subsection" id="2026_brilliant">
              <p><strong>I am finally fixing my lackings in math with <a href="https://brilliant.org/" target="_blank">Brilliant</a>. <em>Highly recommended!!</em></strong></p>
              <p>
                I started on the free tier for 70+ days, it was pretty great since I could access all courses, but I was limited to 2 lessons per day;
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                on Black Friday there was a 30% rebate on a 12 months plan so I couldn't resist,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                and I have already blasted through several courses already and am hoping to finish everything in under a year if possible.
              </p>
            </section>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Otherwise, I am <em>superficially</em> in much the same situation as exactly a year ago as described in the previous post, so simply refer to it</strong> and here is the diff:</p>

        <section class="subsection" id="2026_javascript-regexes">

          <p>
            Upgrading my JavaScript skills is done, except I now want to master JavaScript regexes enough to use them easily.
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            My immediate use-case is to parse HTTP ranges, which could easily be done by hand
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            but I decided to do it with a regex and always use them instead of manual parsing when appropriate henceforth.
          </p>

        </section>

        <section class="subsection" id="2026_css-grid">

          <p>
            I did learn CSS Grid, but I only used it in one place so far and it's trivial...
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            I'm sure CSS Grid will be extremely important one day for complex forms...
          </p>

        </section>

        <hr />

        <p>So, mostly just refer to the first big paragraph of the previous post for what I want to do in 2026...</p>

        <section class="subsection" id="2026_huge-productivity-boost,awesome-daily-schedule">

          <p>
            <strong><em>I am expecting a HUGE, permanent productivity boost starting in 2026,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                which should let me plow through my backlog much faster than usual.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                I could theoretically achieve nearly 365 days of productivity per year!!!</em></strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            That's because I believe I have achieved a critical point in optimizing my daily life schedule.
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            It's an incredibly simple but effective plan, so I think not much could possibly go wrong. (Famous last words?)
          </p>

          <p>My awesome daily schedule is simply:</p>

          <ol class="list" start="0">
            <li>
              <p>
                ALWAYS get out of bed at 8AM or earlier, ensured by always setting my alarm clock for that time,
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                being forced to get out of bed to go turn it off (and immediately turning it back on for the next day), and NEVER getting back into bed to rest some more.
                <br class="if-wide"/>
                I will thus be VERY motivated not to go to bed too late, preferably early enough that I will easily get out of bed even before the alarm clock rings out.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Morning is generally for hard productivity such as programming.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Afternoon is generally for soft productivity such as Brilliant and learning the piano.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>After 4PM is for entertainment stuff such as YouTube.</p>

          <p>
            2025 will be a <em>truly insane</em> year for me in terms of critical infrastructure upgrades,
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            most notably I will finally use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/" target="_blank">a database</a> after <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#experience_programmer-at-Hexstream-Software" target="_blank">nearly 15 years of not using one</a>, and I also need to implement a "Login with GitHub" system and then <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/#hexstreamsoft-sponsors-2.0" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft Sponsors 2.0</a>.
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            I also need to upgrade from Debian 11 to Debian 13, which implies I must make a huge cleanup of my workstation and hopefully finally implement a <em>sane</em> backup procedure.
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            I also need to migrate everything from Cloudflare Pages to Cloudflare Workers + Assets in October, and I would like to add some new content and features and launch some new websites.
            <br class="if-wide"/>
            I am sure some <em>unknown unknowns</em> will further delay things as well.

            Many of those upgrades will make it easier to implement HexstreamSoft Sponsors 2.0, or will otherwise make things easier for me.
