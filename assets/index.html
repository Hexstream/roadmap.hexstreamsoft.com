              <p class="good-news"><strong>lispy-format 1.0 properly translates the essence of <code>format</code> into a proper s-expressions form. <em>A guaranteed smash hit!</em></strong></p>
              <p>I know exactly what the final product will look like. There are 2 levels: individual functions which can be used standalone or in concert, and a macro for concisely and efficiently combining multiple output operations in one go.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be far more readable than <code>format</code>, and it will be completely modular and extensible. And of course, it properly uses the package system, so you can easily write your own extended version of the standard built-in operators if you like, or design your own features which will seamlessly integrate with built-in features and third-party features.</p>
              <p>One of several advantages of lispy-format 1.0 is that a command's arguments are specified with the command instead of all commands being specified ahead of time and then all arguments, making it hard to correlate commands with their arguments.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be very easy to learn, regardless of the user's level of proficiency with <code>format</code>. That said, <code>format</code> experts will find many familiar similarities compared to <code>format</code>, making transition easy. Tools should eventually be provided to help migration.</p>

              <p>This is a spiritual successor to my various Loopless projects that I worked on for years and <a href="https://x.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" class="tweet"> deleted relatively recently</a>, and other related work such as <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/multiple-value-variants/#mapcar" target="_blank">multiple-value mapping</a>. I completely stopped using <code>loop</code> eons ago and now make heavy use of <code>mapcar</code> and friends, but this is not enough and after several iterations of failed attempts at LOOP replacement, I finally came up with a truly revolutionary paradigm shift in computer science (or at least, a very big evolutionary leap). This is actually just a different arrangement of already existing concepts such as iterators, but designed and integrated in a much more flexible and powerful way without sacrificing performance (and in fact, improving it).</p>
              <p>I already know what the project will be called, but I'm keeping it a secret until a first release.</p>
              <p>I already know exactly what the high-level syntax and semantics will be. I could trivially tell you what it is, but I want to keep all the glory for myself on this one. ;P (It took me quite a bit of really hard work to reach that point, and if I immediately revealed the fruits of my labor then someone could implement a crude version and reap all the glory before I have perfected the entirety of the design at all layers of abstraction.) The high-level syntax and semantics is actually just an embarrassingly simple variation on one of the standard Common Lisp constructs.</p>
              <p>As for the mid-level and low-level semantics, I have some good ideas about it, but much work yet remains to be done. I recently became an expert in an area of the <a href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">MOP</a> that I believe will be absolutely crucial to the mid-level and low-level semantics.</p>
              <p>I have already spent several months designing this on graph paper. I am now ready to try actually implementing this (once I'm done with the above work items).</p>

                <em>My Spanish is already pretty good</em>, thanks to <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>.
                <br />
                I already almost finished their <em>extensive</em> Spanish course,
                <br />
                already with more than 500000XP!
              </p>

              <p>
                <em>My Portuguese unfortunately needs more work.</em>
                <br />
                Duolingo's Portuguese-from-Spanish course is too basic.
                <br />
                Now, I want to do the Portuguese-from-English course.
              </p>

              <p>
                I would already have a <em title="as of 2 november 2023">798 days streak</em> on Duolingo
                <br />
                if I hadn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerhaave_syndrome" target="_blank">almost died for no reason</a> in May 2023...
                <br />
                I already have 900000+ XP across all courses.
                <br />
                Duolingo is almost like a part-time job for me...
                <br />
                This significantly slows down my operations,
                <br />
                but <strong>will doubtless pay great dividends later!</strong>

                Mastering Common Lisp takes several years, <em>it's a huge investment</em>.
                <br />
                <em>Many learners give up early</em>, due to the pretty tough learning curve.
              </p>

              <p>
                Furthermore, the language is mostly oriented towards programmers.
                <br />
                <em>There is very little chance a non-programmer would want to use it.</em>
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>
                    The <em class="watch-out">lack of manpower</em> is a HUGE drag on community development.
                    <br />
                    The <em class="watch-out">lack of popularity</em> constantly undermines our marketing efforts.
