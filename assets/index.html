              <p>There are a billion Common Lisp unit testing frameworks, none of which I find appealing. (Ok, honestly I don't even want to check, as clearly none of them could possibly appeal to my very specific tastes by chance.)</p>

              <p>I have been using <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/parachute" target="_blank">Parachute</a>,<br />but I'm confident I can make something I like much better.</p>

              <p>I will make a unit testing framework leveraging <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/definitions-systems/" target="_blank">definitions-systems</a> for extreme simplicity and extensibility. With <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/" target="_blank">30+ ready-to-use libraries</a>, I already have plenty of incentive to make a great unit testing framework for myself, even if nobody else used it.</p>

              <p>The focus of the initial version will be to be good enough <em>for me</em>, but I hope to <em>eventually</em> make it the best Common Lisp unit testing framework, though it could take years. The first version could theoretically already be the best Common Lisp unit testing framework, but given that I won't even review the capabilities of the other existing unit testing frameworks, this seems highly unlikely.</p>

              <p>Ideally, eventually I would take the time to do such a review and improve my unit testing framework until it's effectively a conceptual superset of all the other unit testing frameworks, at least with respect to their intrinsically desirable features.</p>

              <p>I usually try to make a "best of breed" library with the first release, but I believe this would represent way too much work in this case, and would push back other very important projects like <a href="#lispy-format-1.0">lispy-format 1.0</a> way too much. Maybe I'll just give up and review the other libraries before making my own after all, but no promises...</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_format.htm" target="_blank">format</a> is a disgrace, a black mark on Common Lisp. Packing a complex control language into a string is deeply insane when we could and should just use s-expressions. <code>format</code> is the single worst-designed feature in Common Lisp, even worse than <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loop.htm" target="_blank">loop</a>. <code>format</code> is <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/490937766411509761" target="_blank" class="tweet">not extensible, despite the very constrained <code>~/~/</code> escape hatch</a>.</p>

              <p>lispy-format 1.0 properly translates the essence of <code>format</code> into a proper s-expressions form. A guaranteed smash hit!</p>
              <p>I know exactly what the final product will look like. There are 2 levels: individual functions which can be used standalone or in concert, and a macro for concisely and efficiently combining multiple output operations in one go.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be far more readable than <code>format</code>, and it will be completely modular and extensible. And of course, it properly uses the package system, so you can easily write your own extended version of the standard built-in operators if you like, or design your own features which will seamlessly integrate with built-in features and third-party features.</p>
              <p>One of several advantages of lispy-format 1.0 is that a command's arguments are specified with the command instead of all commands being specified ahead of time and then all arguments, making it hard to correlate commands with their arguments.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be very easy to learn, regardless of the user's level of proficiency with <code>format</code>. That said, <code>format</code> experts will find many familiar similarities compared to <code>format</code>, making transition easy. Tools should eventually be provided to help migration.</p>

              <p>After a surprisingly long and torturous path, I finally resumed work on this, but quickly hit a snag which resulted in a reshuffling and expansion of my roadmap, so this has been pushed back again, sorry.</p>

              <p>This library will implement a revolutionary new paradigm for iteration and mapping. It is extremely simple, intuitive, modular, flexible, powerful and optimizable, and easily scales from trivial use-cases to very complex, so you can just use it always. It will basically obsolete every iteration and mapping construct you know of, and then some.</p>

              <p>This is a spiritual successor to my various Loopless projects that I worked on for years and <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" class="tweet"> deleted relatively recently</a>, and other related work such as <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/multiple-value-variants/#mapcar" target="_blank">multiple-value mapping</a>. I completely stopped using <code>loop</code> eons ago and now make heavy use of <code>mapcar</code> and friends, but this is not enough and after several iterations of failed attempts at LOOP replacement, I finally came up with a truly revolutionary paradigm shift in computer science (or at least, a very big evolutionary leap). This is actually just a different arrangement of already existing concepts such as iterators, but designed and integrated in a much more flexible and powerful way without sacrificing performance (and in fact, improving it).</p>
              <p>I already know what the project will be called, but I'm keeping it a secret until a first release.</p>
              <p>I already know exactly what the high-level syntax and semantics will be. I could trivially tell you what it is, but I want to keep all the glory for myself on this one. ;P (It took me quite a bit of really hard work to reach that point, and if I immediately revealed the fruits of my labor then someone could implement a crude version and reap all the glory before I have perfected the entirety of the design at all layers of abstraction.) The high-level syntax and semantics is actually just an embarrassingly simple variation on one of the standard Common Lisp constructs.</p>
              <p>As for the mid-level and low-level semantics, I have some good ideas about it, but much work yet remains to be done. I recently became an expert in an area of the <a href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">MOP</a> that I believe will be absolutely crucial to the mid-level and low-level semantics.</p>
              <p>I have already spent several months designing this on graph paper. I am now ready to try actually implementing this (once I'm done with the above work items).</p>

                All existing web frameworks suck.
                <br />
                (No, I don't need to review them to know it's true.)
              </p>

              <p>My first web framework <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#experience_programmer-at-Hexstream-Software" target="_blank">was pretty nice in some ways</a>, but I ultimately had to <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scrap it</a>. I've been writing my websites in raw HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ever since while waiting to finally write my second web framework.</p>

              <p>My second web framework will make it easy to manage hundreds of (heterogeneous) subdomains, and will feature full semantic tracing as a core feature.</p>

              <p>I have several awesome ideas for this, which I mostly forgot because I haven't revisited this stuff in a while, but they are sure to come back when I finally get back to this...</p>

              <p>I'm already a pretty advanced expert in Common Lisp, HTML5 and CSS3, and I'm building on the experience of my first fairly advanced web framework, so I have a very solid base to start.</p>

              <p>I already single-handedly wrote and am successfully managing 100+ mobile-optimized HTML pages written in raw HTML5 and CSS3, spread across <a href="https://abc.hexstream.xyz/websites/" target="_blank">25+ subdomains in 4 main websites</a>, so clearly I am VERY motivated to finally make a great web framework, and it had better make it super easy to manage several dozens of subdomains because my web presence is only going to expand...</p>
