              <p>There are a billion Common Lisp unit testing frameworks, none of which I find appealing. (Ok, honestly I don't even want to check, as clearly none of them could possibly appeal to my very specific tastes by chance.)</p>

              <p>I have been using <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/parachute" target="_blank">Parachute</a>,<br />but I'm confident I can make something I like much better.</p>

              <p>I will make a unit testing framework leveraging <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/definitions-systems/" target="_blank">definitions-systems</a> for extreme simplicity and extensibility. With <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/" target="_blank">30+ ready-to-use libraries</a>, I already have plenty of incentive to make a great unit testing framework for myself, even if nobody else used it.</p>

              <p>The focus of the initial version will be to be good enough <em>for me</em>, but I hope to <em>eventually</em> make it the best Common Lisp unit testing framework, though it could take years. The first version could theoretically already be the best Common Lisp unit testing framework, but given that I won't even review the capabilities of the other existing unit testing frameworks, this seems highly unlikely.</p>

              <p>Ideally, eventually I would take the time to do such a review and improve my unit testing framework until it's effectively a conceptual superset of all the other unit testing frameworks, at least with respect to their intrinsically desirable features.</p>

              <p>I usually try to make a "best of breed" library with the first release, but I believe this would represent way too much work in this case, and would push back other very important projects like <a href="#lispy-format-1.0">lispy-format 1.0</a> way too much. Maybe I'll just give up and review the other libraries before making my own after all, but no promises...</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_format.htm" target="_blank">format</a> is a disgrace, a black mark on Common Lisp. Packing a complex control language into a string is deeply insane when we could and should just use s-expressions. <code>format</code> is the single worst-designed feature in Common Lisp, even worse than <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loop.htm" target="_blank">loop</a>. <code>format</code> is <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/490937766411509761" target="_blank" class="tweet">not extensible, despite the very constrained <code>~/~/</code> escape hatch</a>.</p>
              <p>It is simply mind-boggling that <code>format</code> is still used and largely embraced by the community in 2020.</p>

              <p>lispy-format 1.0 properly translates the essence of <code>format</code> into a proper s-expressions form. A guaranteed smash hit!</p>
              <p>I know exactly what the final product will look like. There are 2 levels: individual functions which can be used standalone or in concert, and a macro for concisely and efficiently combining multiple output operations in one go.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be far more readable than <code>format</code>, and it will be completely modular and extensible. And of course, it properly uses the package system, so you can easily write your own extended version of the standard built-in operators if you like, or design your own features which will seamlessly integrate with built-in features and third-party features.</p>
              <p>One of several advantages of lispy-format 1.0 is that a command's arguments are specified with the command instead of all commands being specified ahead of time and then all arguments, making it hard to correlate commands with their arguments.</p>
              <p>lispy-format 1.0 will be very easy to learn, regardless of the user's level of proficiency with <code>format</code>. That said, <code>format</code> experts will find many familiar similarities compared to <code>format</code>, making transition easy. Tools should eventually be provided to help migration.</p>
