              <p>This library will implement a revolutionary new paradigm for iteration and mapping. It is extremely simple, intuitive, modular, flexible, powerful and optimizable, and easily scales from trivial use-cases to very complex, so you can just use it always. It will basically obsolete every iteration and mapping construct you know of, and then some.</p>

              <p>This is a spiritual successor to my various Loopless projects that I worked on for years and <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" class="tweet"> deleted relatively recently</a>, and other related work such as <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/multiple-value-variants/#mapcar" target="_blank">multiple-value mapping</a>. I completely stopped using <code>loop</code> eons ago and now make heavy use of <code>mapcar</code> and friends, but this is not enough and after several iterations of failed attempts at LOOP replacement, I finally came up with a truly revolutionary paradigm shift in computer science (or at least, a very big evolutionary leap). This is actually just a different arrangement of already existing concepts such as iterators, but designed and integrated in a much more flexible and powerful way without sacrificing performance (and in fact, improving it).</p>
              <p>I already know what the project will be called, but I'm keeping it a secret until a first release.</p>
              <p>I already know exactly what the high-level syntax and semantics will be. I could trivially tell you what it is, but I want to keep all the glory for myself on this one. ;P (It took me quite a bit of really hard work to reach that point, and if I immediately revealed the fruits of my labor then someone could implement a crude version and reap all the glory before I have perfected the entirety of the design at all layers of abstraction.) The high-level syntax and semantics is actually just an embarrassingly simple variation on one of the standard Common Lisp constructs.</p>
              <p>As for the mid-level and low-level semantics, I have some good ideas about it, but much work yet remains to be done. I recently became an expert in an area of the <a href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">MOP</a> that I believe will be absolutely crucial to the mid-level and low-level semantics.</p>
              <p>I have already spent several months designing this on graph paper. I am now ready to try actually implementing this (once I'm done with the above work items).</p>

                All existing web frameworks suck.

                (No, I don't need to review them to know it's true.)
              </p>

              <p>My first web framework <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#experience_programmer-at-Hexstream-Software" target="_blank">was pretty nice in some ways</a>, but I ultimately had to <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scrap it</a>. I've been writing my websites in raw HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ever since while waiting to finally write my second web framework.</p>

              <p>My second web framework will make it easy to manage hundreds of (heterogeneous) subdomains, and will feature full semantic tracing as a core feature.</p>

              <p>I have several awesome ideas for this, which I mostly forgot because I haven't revisited this stuff in a while, but they are sure to come back when I finally get back to this...</p>

              <p>I'm already a pretty advanced expert in Common Lisp, HTML5 and CSS3, and I'm building on the experience of my first fairly advanced web framework, so I have a very solid base to start.</p>

              <p>I already single-handedly wrote and am successfully managing 100+ mobile-optimized HTML pages written in raw HTML5 and CSS3, spread across <a href="https://abc.hexstream.xyz/websites/" target="_blank">25+ subdomains in 4 main websites</a>, so clearly I am VERY motivated to finally make a great web framework, and it had better make it super easy to manage several dozens of subdomains because my web presence is only going to expand...</p>

              <p>I think my <a href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">modern public domain CLOS MOP specification</a> proves that I am entirely capable of tackling this project and doing a really great job.</p>
