              <p>Lambda lists being one of the most omnipresent features in Common Lisp, obviously it would be incredibly useful to be able to manipulate them easily.</p>

              <p>Very few projects even try to tackle this problem, and none of them make a good job of it or are enjoyable to use.</p>

                All existing web frameworks suck.

              </p>

              <p>My first web framework <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#experience_programmer-at-Hexstream-Software" target="_blank">was pretty nice in some ways</a>, but I ultimately had to <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scrap it</a>. I've been writing my websites in raw HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ever since while waiting to finally write my second web framework.</p>

              <p>My second web framework will make it easy to manage hundreds of (heterogeneous) subdomains, and will feature full semantic tracing as a core feature.</p>

              <p>I have several awesome ideas for this, which I mostly forgot because I haven't revisited this stuff in a while, but they are sure to come back when I finally get back to this...</p>

              <p>I'm already a pretty advanced expert in Common Lisp, HTML5 and CSS3, and I'm building on the experience of my first fairly advanced web framework, so I have a very solid base to start.</p>

              <p>I already single-handedly wrote and am successfully managing 100+ mobile-optimized HTML pages written in raw HTML5 and CSS3, spread across <a href="https://abc.hexstream.xyz/websites/" target="_blank">25+ subdomains in 4 main websites</a>, so clearly I am VERY motivated to finally make a great web framework, and it had better make it super easy to manage several dozens of subdomains because my web presence is only going to expand...</p>
